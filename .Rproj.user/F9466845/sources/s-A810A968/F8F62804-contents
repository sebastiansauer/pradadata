#' Embeddedness VS Autonomy:Embeddedness appears in situations where individuals are embedded in a collectivity and find meaning through social relationships,through identifying with the group,participating in its shared way of life,and striving toward its shared goals.In embeddedness societies personal interests are not seen as different from those of the group and high value is placed on preserving the status quo and avoiding individual actions or attitudes that might undermine the traditional order of things.Important values in such societies are social order,respect for tradition,security,obedience and wisedom.While autonomy refers to the situation where individuals are viewed as autonomous.bounded entities that are expected to cultivate and express their own preferences,feelings,ideas,and abilities and find meaning in their own uniqueness.Autonomy is further broken down into two categories:intellectual autonomy which refers to the independent prusuit of ideas ,intellectual derections and rights;affective autonomy,which refers to the independent pursuit of affectively positive experiences such as varied life,pleasure and enjoyment of life.

#' Hierarchy VS Egalitarianism:In hierarchical societies individuals and the resources associated with society are organized hierarchically and individuals within those societies are socialized to comply with the roles assigned to them in the hierarchy and subjected to sanctions if they fail to comply.Modesty and self-control are values associated with hierarchy.In egalitarian societies individuals are seen as moral equals and everyone shares the same basic interests as human beings.In egalitarian societies people are socialized to internalize a commitment to cooperate and to feel concern for everyone's welfare.Valued associated with egalitarian societies include socail justice and caring for the weaker members of the society,honesty,equality,sympathy and working for the good of others,social responsibility and voluntary cooperation in the pursuit of well-being or prosperity for others within the society.

#'Mastery VS Harmony:Mastery refers to the situation wher individuals value succeeding and getting ahead through self-assertion and proactively seek to master,direct and change the natural and social world to advance their personal interests and the interests of the groups to which they belong.Specific values associated with mastery include independence,fearlessness and daring,ambition and hard work,drive for success and competence.Harmony refers to the situation wher individuals are content to accept and fit into the natural and social world as they find it and seek to understand,preserve and protect it rather than change,direct or exploit it.Important values in societies where harmony is valued include world at peace,unity with nature,and protecting the environment.
