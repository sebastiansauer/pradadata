\description{
Data from an online dating/mating app experiment with IV "car as status symbol"
(yes vs. no) and DV1 "matching" (number) and DV2 "message sent" (number).
The principal research question was whether a luxury sports car (BMW Z4)
on the individual profile portrait photo at an online dating app
would have an influence on the number of contact requests
and messages sent to this profile.
Care was taken that the profiles showed no difference besides the car.
